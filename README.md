# What I Learned In Week 3

## Variables
* Can be imagined as virtual containers.
* Variables can be declared by using certain keywords:
  * `let` - Declares variable that can be reassigned on a line below;
  * `const` - Preferred keyword for declaration. Declares variable that cannot be reassigned;
  * `var` -  Outdated keyword. Almost the same functionality as `let`.

### For example:
---
        let x = 5;
        x = 4;
### We declared `x` as 5 using `let` keyword. On the line below we've changed the value of `x` to 4; 
---

    const x = 6;
### This time we used `const` to declare `x`. This variable cannot be re-declared without changing the original value.
