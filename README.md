# What I Learned In Week 3

## Variables
* Can be imagined as virtual containers.
* Variables can be declared by using certain keywords:
  * `let` - Declares variable that can be reassigned on a line below;
  * `const` - Preferred keyword for declaration. Declares variable that cannot be reassigned;
  * `var` -  Outdated keyword. Almost the same functionality as `let`.
